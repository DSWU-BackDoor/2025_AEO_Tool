# AEO Security Tool
> Automate AEO compliance verification with SBOM-based security scanning and ISMS integration.

## üöÄ Overview
AEO Security Tool is a CLI-based automation pipeline for AEO (Authorized Economic Operator) compliance verification, providing SBOM generation, vulnerability scanning, EOL checking, and automated report generation with digital signatures.
<br><br>The project is designed for automated security auditing, compliance verification, and standardized evidence generation for AEO certification, with seamless integration into modern CI/CD workflows.

## ‚ú® Features
### Automated SBOM Generation
Integrates with Syft to automatically generate Software Bill of Materials in CycloneDX format.<br>
### Vulnerability Scanning 
Uses Grype to detect CVEs, map CVSS scores, and identify security vulnerabilities in software components.<br>
### EOL/EOS Detection
Automatically checks End-of-Life status for all software components using endoflife.date API.<br>
### Compliance Reporting
Generates standardized PDF reports mapped to ISMS vulnerability management requirements for AEO certification.<br>
### Digital Signatures
Uses Cosign to digitally sign reports and artifacts, ensuring integrity and authenticity.<br>
### CI/CD Integration
Command-line interface and GitHub Actions support for easy integration into automated workflows.<br>
